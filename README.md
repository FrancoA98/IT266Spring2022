# Deliverables
1) 10 melee weapons
2) off-hand gun that stuns enemies
3) blood vials and quicksilver bullets
4) Enemies award blood echoes
5) "Messenger" shop to buy upgrades, which allow the weapons to scale accordingly.

# Main Gameplay
The player should be able to use the 10 melee weapons to combat with enemies. Also, by pressing "t", the player is able to use the off-hand gun to stun enemies.
Upon completion, the health of the player and the times the player is able to use the off-hand gun will be determined by the blood vials and quicksilver bullets
respectively. In addition, the enemies should drop blood echoes and they should be displayed. Ultimately, the player should be able to use a shop to upgrade their
health and, also, the weapons.
